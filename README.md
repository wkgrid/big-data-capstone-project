# Big Data - Capstone Project - Solution

The solution is in the jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Github allows to view it directly when opened so there is no need to install anything locally.

I limited the documentation to the very minimum. 
Also I think there was no need (and even place) for unit testing and integration tests.
